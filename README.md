# TinyML Bird Recognition – Internship Project

This is an ongoing internship project focused on bird species recognition using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) techniques.  
The goal is to recognize bird sounds in real-time on low-power embedded hardware.

## Project Goal

Build a lightweight AI model that can identify bird species from their vocalizations and deploy it on a low-power board like the Arduino Nicla Voice.
