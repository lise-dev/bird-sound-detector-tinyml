  <h2><strong>Title: </strong>Using TinyML for sound-based bird species recognition</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Description: </strong>This project explores the use of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) techniques to enable real-time, on-device recognition of bird species through their vocalizations. The goal is to develop a lightweight AI model capable of identifying different bird species based on audio recordings, optimized for deployment on low-power, resource-constrained edge devices. The project involves obtaining valid datasets for the target bird species, preprocessing sound data into spectrograms or other audio features, training and compressing neural network models for TinyML deployment, and evaluating performance using standard classification metrics. Such a system can support biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts in remote or ecologically sensitive areas such as the Torrevieja Lagoon in Spain.
